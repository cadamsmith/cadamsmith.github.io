          <p>I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented engineer who is most content when being a productive member of a high-functioning team.</p>

          <p>I enjoy modeling complex, real-world domains in software, particularly ones that result in interesting database structures.</p>
          
          <p>
            I also have a strong passion for studying theoretical mathematics, especially cryptography and number theory.
